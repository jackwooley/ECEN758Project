# ECEN758Project

This is a project for Texas A&M's ECEN 758 class. Our objective is to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset and then build a report from it. 

Our group is composed of Jack Wooley, Vinay Chandra Bandi, and Matt Palmer. We are all students in [Texas A&M's Master's of Data Science program](https://tamids.tamu.edu/).

Before running the model if required:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
The 'classification_final' ipynb file is the final file that contains all the code for the project. The GridsearchCV code used to tune the Machine learning models is in the other files (lda_imp.py, clean_normalized.ipynb).
```
